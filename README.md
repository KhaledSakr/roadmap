# Roadmap
An after graduation self-learning roadmap to prepare myself for the current market's standards in Software Engineering and Data Science.

The curriculum is divided into four fields, I consider these the big winners by current industry standards:
- Software Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Big Data
- Game Development

The roadmap will contain detailed checkpoints for each field, including links for valuable tutorials or courses that can be used. But this is not a must, if you find other or better sources, feel free to replace, and even notify me to update the tutorial if needed.

# Software Engineering
1. Revise OOP and Design Patterns
    - [Introduction to Object Oriented programming](http://ee402.eeng.dcu.ie/introduction/chapter-1---introduction-to-object-oriented-programming)
    - [Design Patterns](http://www.oodesign.com/)
2. Revise Algorithms and Data Structures
    - [This answer from qoura](https://www.quora.com/What-basic-data-structures-and-algorithms-should-one-learn-before-starting-competitive-programming)
        > There are hundreds of Data Structures and Algorithms to learn, but the most important thing is to learn their use cases and complexity, then try to implement them by hand.
3. Cryptography
    - [Applied Cryptography by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/applied-cryptography--cs387)
        > Some of the algorithms used in Cryptography, such as RSA, are really beneficial as a learning experience to be implemented by hand, and it's completely worth the time.
4. Testing
    - [Why is Unit Testing important?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-software-unit-testing-and-why-is-it-important)
        > You need to practice Unit Testing through implementing it in a project using any of the frameworks available for the language you code your project with. For example PHPUnit, Django unittest, Python Nose, Boost Test, etc.
    - [Unit Testing for Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/testing/overview/)
    - [Google Test C++ Test Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest)
5. Agile
    - The Art of Agile Development (Book)
    - [Scrum Guide](http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

# Machine Learning
1. Linear Algebra
    - [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra by Prof. Gilbert Strang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8)
        > I believe it's necessary to completely finish this course before starting to delve into Machine Learning.
2. Optimization Techniques
    - [MIT's Optimization Problems by John Guttag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1lhuz6pZC0)
3. Data Science
    - [Harvard's CS109 Data Science](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)
        > This is focused more into the practical side of things.
4. Deep Learning
    - [Oxford's Deep NLP](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures)
5. Kaggle Competitions

# Big Data
1. Revise SQL
    - [Coursera's Managing Big Data with MySQL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql)
2. Hadoop Ecosystem
    - [Udemy's Learn Big Data](https://www.udemy.com/learn-big-data-the-hadoop-ecosystem-masterclass/)
3. MongoDB
    - [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)
    
# Game Development
1. Introduction
	- [Wikipedia's Article on Game Programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_programmer)

	- Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory (Book)
4. CUDA
	- [Udacity's Intro to Parallel Programming by  Nvidia](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344)
5. Game Analytics
	- [Becoming a Games Analyst](http://www.gameanalytics.com/blog/becoming-games-analyst.html)
    
# Miscellaneous
